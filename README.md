### Hi there 👋

Electronics Engineer turned Software Developer by passion ✨

I design and develop data engineering pipelines from scratch with or without event-driven distributed serverless infrastructure. I like to learn new languages, technologies and tools. Then, explore how they work internally, compare them with existing ones and use them in my projects 🌱. 

I'm always excited about new projects, collaborations, and creative challenges and do checkout [sumedhaasanjeevan.com](http://sumedhaasanjeevan.com/)! 💬
