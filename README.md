### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I design and develop data engineering pipelines from scratch with event-driven distributed serverless infrastructure. I like to learn new languages,technologies and tools. Then, compare them with existing ones and upgrade my projectsâœ¨. 

I'm always excited about new projects, collaborations, and creative challenges and do checkout [sumedhaasanjeevan.com](http://sumedhaasanjeevan.com/)!ğŸ’¬
